  <h1>Petals around the rose</h1>

  <ol>
    <li>The name of the game is Petals Around the Rose, and the name is important.</li>
    <li>The answer will always be an even number or 0.</li>
    <li>I can tell you the result of any roll of the dice.</li>
  </ol>

  <div class="js">


  </div>

  <p>If you're able to figure out how the results are made, then you become a member of a secret society called The
    Potentate of the Rose.
    But you must not give the answer to anyone else and you must figure it out on your own! <br>
